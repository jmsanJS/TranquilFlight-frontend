# TranquilFlight
## React Native mobile app

**TranquilFlight** is a simplified mobile flight tracking application. It allows frequent or occasional travelers to easily and concisely obtain the most important flight information.

It was entirely created by a group of two developers ([medkar](https://github.com/medkar) and me). We followed the Agile Scrum method to build this project from A to Z.
